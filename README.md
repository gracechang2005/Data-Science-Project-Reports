This repository contains my final project report from STAT 303-1 Data Science with Python 1, a course focusing on data wrangling, aggregation, analysis, visualization, and more using the Python language.
This project was done in collaboration with three other classmates, and we analyzed crime in the Greater Chicago area, identifying important trends and subsetting the data to run deeper analyses.
